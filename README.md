# BlenderPhysPuppet
Addon to create a physics 'puppet' from an armature, with a duplicate armature to control the movement. Designed for Blender 2.8.
To use, run the script in blender and open the rightmost toolbar to see the puppet physics tab. Select the bones which you want to be turned into a puppet in pose mode, then go back into object mode with the armature selected which you want to apply the effect to. Once you have clicked 'create armature puppet' and it has generated a duplicate armature, drag the newly generated armature to a convenient location and begin animating using the duplicate armature. If you run the simulation and make changes, try doing a translate and cancel it on one of the physics objects just to wake it up (or however you're meant to get it to forget a cache)
