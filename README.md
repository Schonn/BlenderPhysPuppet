# BlenderPhysPuppet
Updated for Blender 3.4.1
Work in progress addon to create a physics 'puppet' from an armature, with a duplicate armature to control movement.
The tools are located under Puppet Physics in the right menu in the 3d viewport in object mode.
Select the bones you want to control in any number of armatures in pose mode, then go to object mode. Select the armatures you wish to add physics puppet to. In object mode, press 'Make Puppet From Armature'.
The original rig will be controlled by the duplicate rig using rigid body constraints.
