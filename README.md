# BlenderPhysPuppet
Addon to create a physics 'puppet' from an armature, with a duplicate armature to control the movement. Designed for Blender 2.8.
To use, run the script in blender and open the rightmost toolbar to see the puppet physics tab. Select the bones which you want to be turned into a puppet in pose mode, then go back into object mode with the armature selected which you want to apply the effect to. Once you have clicked 'create armature puppet' and it has generated a duplicate armature, drag the newly generated armature to a convenient location and begin animating using the duplicate armature. When you make a change or add animation using the control armature, translate an object and cancel the translate to force the rigid body world to recalculate and then click on Scene > Rigid Body World > Cache > Calculate to Frame to quickly re-simulate up to the current timeline position.
